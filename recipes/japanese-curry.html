    <h2>Delicious Japanese Curry recipe for a soothing dinner! Tender chicken, soft carrots and potatoes, cooked in a rich, savory curry sauce. Yummy!</h2>
    <p>Description of Recipe Here</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 carrots</li>
        <li>2 onions</li>
        <li>3 Yukon gold potatoes</li>
        <li>1 tsp ginger</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>1/2 apple</li>
        <li>More, you get the idea</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all the ingredients. Please read my blog post on the “secret ingredient” we add to the curry. For this recipe, I add ginger, garlic, apple, honey, soy sauce, and ketchup.</li>
        <li>Cut 2 onions into wedges. I like to have the texture of the onions in my curry, so I cut them into thick wedges. If you prefer, you can mince or thinly slice the onions so they disintegrate into the sauce.</li>
        <li>Peel 3 Yukon gold potatoes and cut them into quarters. Soak them in water for 15 minutes to remove excess starch. Tip: Yukon gold potatoes hold their shape well. You can use russet potatoes, but they tend to disintegrate into the broth during cooking, so cut them into 6 pieces each and add to the pot toward the end of cooking.</li>
        <li>More steps, you get the idea</li>
